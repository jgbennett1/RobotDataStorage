Follow the instructions at https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.3.x/installation/ to download Flask. Once it is installed, run the command "python3 app.py" to activate a server. There will be a list of addresses in the command line. Use the one with your public IP address when you send data to this application from another device.

This application stores data in JSON files and makes a new one when it receives a new UserID. Only send the string "UserID" to this if you want a new file to be created.
